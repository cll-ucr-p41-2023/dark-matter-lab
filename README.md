# dark-matter-lab

## Introduction

In this lab, we will visualize and analyze Vera Rubin's evidence for the existence of dark matter, which was published in her paper, [&#34;Rotation of the Andromeda Nebula from a Spectroscopic Survey of Emission Regions&#34;](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1970ApJ...159..379R), in February 1970. You can read more about Rubin and her discovery [here](https://www.aps.org/apsnews/2023/05/vera-rubin-paper-dark-matter).
